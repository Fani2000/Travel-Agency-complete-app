# Travel Agency from the Udemy course with Juan Pablo

# The app enables users to view all the available travels and add testimonials to the database which uses mysql server and sequelize to make interacting with mysql server much easy(ORM - Object Rational Mapping)

- To Read more about ORM, here is the link `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping`
- basically ORM allows the creation of models in the code and then those models are then mapped to sql tables which makes querying and inserting the database easy without the use of sql syntax, Sequelize does that for you.
